# What's Sedy
Sedy is a GitHub webhook which allows pull-request reviewers to fix typos themselves by typing sed-like commands on review comments.

### How it works
After installing Sedy on your repository, just type a sed-like command (`s/[old text]/[new text]/`) in a single comment or in a code review, and Sedy will quickly commit the fix.


# Installation
